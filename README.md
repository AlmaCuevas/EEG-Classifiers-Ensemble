# Voting system EEG Data Classification

All the codes here are from other contributors:
* pyRiemann
* XDAWN -> Good for 4 classes

Maybe I should abandone these ones:
* TCACNet -> https://github.com/LiuXiaolin-lxl/TCACNet
* BigProject 
* LSTM, at least that project in particular, you could try with other LSTM libraries. It gave bad results, but maybe other will be better.

Abandoned:
* LMDA-Net
* EEGNET and cousins
* CCSPNet
* AugmentBrain

They were modified to accomodate the needs for the project.

#  The Datasets are provided by:
* Aguilera
* Nieto
* Coretto
* Torres

#TODO:
* Install the minimum amount of dependencies to make sure those are the ones that the project really needs. You need to go to requirements.txt and check none are missing or are extra.
* Cite code
* Cite datasets and mention why they were chosen
